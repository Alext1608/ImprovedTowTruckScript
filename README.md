# TowScript
A modified version of Asser90's tow script I made a few months back and never did release it.

## Changes
- Fixes attach/detach positions on both truck and ground.
- No more "jello" vehicles that stretch and warp when being towed.

## How it works:
- Spawn in or find a flatbed truck.
- Get out and walk up to the vehicle you want to tow.
- While facing the vehicle type /tow in chat to attach the vehicle to the flatbed.
- Once at your destination type /tow in chat again to detach the vehicle from the flatbed. (Can be done from inside or outside the truck.)
