# TowScript
A modified version of Asser90's tow script with multiple fixes and improvements.

## Changes
- Fixes attach/detach positions on both truck and ground. No more upside down cars when detaching!
- No more "jello" vehicles that stretch and warp when being towed.
- Can no longer detach a vehicle while the truck is moving or attach vehicles while they are moving.
 - Vehicles will detach if the truck flips over.

## How it works:
- Spawn or find a flatbed truck and get in it.
- When you find a vehicle to tow, get out and walk up to the vehicle.
- While facing the vehicle type `/tow` in chat to attach the vehicle to the flatbed.
- Once at your destination, get out of the truck and type `/tow` in chat again to detach the vehicle from the flatbed.

## Known Issues
If another player is next to you when the command is entered the vehicle may not attach/detach. Ask them to step away. This issue was present in the original script and is being worked on.

## Possible Future Features
- Restricted vehicles. (Keep people from towing large vehicles such as a bus or plane.)
- Restrict usage distance. (Towed vehicle and truck must be near each other.)
