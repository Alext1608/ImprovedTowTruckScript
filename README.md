# Tow-Script
Modified version of Asser90's tow script.

## How it works:
- Spawn in or find a Flatbed truck.
- Get out and walk up to the vehicle you want to tow.
- While facing the vehicle type /tow in chat to attach.
- Once at your destination type /tow in chat again to detach the vehicle. (Can be done from inside or outside the truck.)
