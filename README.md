# TowScript
A modified version of Asser90's tow script I made a few months back and never did release it.

## Changes
- Fixes attach/detach positions on both truck and ground. No more upside down cars when detaching!
- No more "jello" vehicles that stretch and warp when being towed.

## How it works:
- Spawn or find a flatbed truck and get in it.
- When you find a vehicle to tow, get out and walk up to the vehicle.
- While facing the vehicle type `/tow` in chat to attach the vehicle to the flatbed.
- Once at your destination type `/tow` in chat again to detach the vehicle from the flatbed. (Can be done from inside or outside the truck.)

## Known Issues
If another player is next to you when the command is entered the vehicle may not attach/detach. Ask them to step away. This issue was present in the original script and I'm unaware of the cause.

## Possible Future Features
- Restricted vehicles. (Keep people from towing large vehicles such as a bus or plane.)
- Allow towed vehicles to become detached if the truck overturns or explodes.
- Restrict command to stationary vehicles. (Right now you can tow a vehicle driving by.)
- Restrict usage distance. (Towed vehicle and truck must be near each other.)
